                    Changes the desired color of the png using C
                    This is a personnal project meant to improve in C and to understand how png worked 
                    (using only wikipedia and other png-related ressources).<br>
                    There are a lot of thing to optimise in this code but it is not the main point

                    A PNG is composed of many Chunck which contains informations about the image.<br>
                    A header (not a Chunck), <b>IDHR</b> which contains informations such has width, height and bit
                    depth,
                    <b>PLTE</b> which is optionnal
                    depending on the type of image but it is needed for my program to work.<br>
                    Then we have the <b>IDAT</b> chunck with the image data and <b>IEND</b> chunck which marks the end
                    of
                    the image.<br>
                </p>
                <div class="box description">
                    Header -> <b>IDHR</b> -> <b>(PLTE)</b> -> <b>IDAT</b>* -> <b>IEND</b><br>
                </div>
                <p class="description">
                    (Those are only the critical chunck which cannot be ignored when parsing)<br><br>
                    On a color type 3 image (indexed color) colors are stored in a Palette in the form (R,G,B) which is
                    then
                    associated
                    to each pixel in the IDAT chunk. Meaning the first color to appear in the Palette is gonna have
                    index 0
                    and the pixel needing this color will be associated with it

                <h2 class="title">What my program does</h2>
                <p class="description">
                    Briefly, my program parses the PNG image, checks if it is indeed a PNG and if it is of color
                    type 3
                    and then displays all colors present in the PLTE Chunck (so all the color present in the image), it
                    then
                    asks user which one to remplace and with what color.<br>
                    I then replace the bytes in the image and update the CRC (which is a way to check no data was
                    lost).<br>
                    As I said in the <a href="#qExplanation" class="no-decoration">Quick explanation</a> each pixel in
                    the
                    image is associated with its color from the Palette, meaning that changing one color<br>
                    changes every pixel associated with it, as you can see in the <a href="#exImages"
                        class="no-decoration">example images</a> the mouth as also changed color because I changed all
                    red
                    pixel to purle<br>
